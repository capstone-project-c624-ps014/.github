## Description

Afiliya is here to elevate visibility for culturally rich Indonesian MSME products, overcoming challenges to recognition and market presence. The main problem we face is how to enhance the visibility of MSME products with cultural significance. According to this problem, we aim to address the following research questions, "How can these products gain broader recognition among the public?". From this question, we conducted research and found that MSME of local cultural products have difficulty competing with "well-known" non-cultural products. That's the reason why we want to assist MSME in improving the visibility of their cultural products. Recognizing the challenges faced by Indonesian MSME in marketing cultural products, our team is committed to overcoming these obstacles. Through a design thinking approach and innovative solutions, we aim to enhance the visibility and economic potential of MSME, contributing to both economic growth and the preservation of local culture.
